Punchout.js
===========

Punchout.js is a library that allows you to take advantage of  Knockout without having to write JavaScript.  Simply decorate your HTML with syntax similar to knockout's data-bind to create the view model.  The MVVM pattern becomes the MV-dom pattern.  This is currently a proof of concept I'm seeking feedback on.
